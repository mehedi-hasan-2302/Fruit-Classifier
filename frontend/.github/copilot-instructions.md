This is a Next.js (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) project for a fruit classifier UI. The app should allow users to upload an image, preview it, and display the top-3 classification results from the backend API. The UI should be modern, responsive, and visually appealing. Integrate the /classify endpoint from the API Gateway. Include clear error handling and loading states.
